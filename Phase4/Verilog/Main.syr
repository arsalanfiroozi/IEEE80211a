Processing Unit <Main> :
	Found 23-bit shift register for signal <Receiver/Queue_OutDeS_23>.
	Found 50-bit shift register for signal <Receiver/Queue_In_49>.
	Found 3-bit shift register for signal <Receiver/Rate_2>.
	Found 3-bit shift register for signal <Transmitter/Rate_2>.
INFO:Xst:741 - HDL ADVISOR - A 59-bit shift register was found for signal <Transmitter/reg_y_Interleaver_59> and currently occupies 59 logic cells (29 slices). Removing the set/reset logic would take advantage of SRL32 (and derived) primitives and reduce this to 1 logic cells (1 slices). Evaluate if the set/reset can be removed for this simple shift register. The majority of simple pipeline structures do not need to be set/reset operationally.
