Processing Unit <Transmitter_2> :
	Found 2-bit shift register for signal <Rate_1>.
INFO:Xst:741 - HDL ADVISOR - A 59-bit shift register was found for signal <reg_y_Interleaver_59> and currently occupies 59 logic cells (29 slices). Removing the set/reset logic would take advantage of SRL32 (and derived) primitives and reduce this to 1 logic cells (1 slices). Evaluate if the set/reset can be removed for this simple shift register. The majority of simple pipeline structures do not need to be set/reset operationally.
