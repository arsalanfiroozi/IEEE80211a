# Implementation of IEEE 802.11a protocol
Based on Xilinx FPGA Scrambling, Descrambling, Encoding, Decoding(Viterbi Decoder), Interleaving, Deinterleaving, and Integration of all modules were implemented in 4 phases. This project is done as a part of the Designing Systems Based on FPGA course. 

Phases' Description: Project_Hint.pdf

In each phase:
- Codes folder contains all the Verilog files.
- Matlab folder contains all the Matlab files for verifying the algorithms and the floating point operations in the circuit by comparing them to the expected output produced by the Matlab script.
- Verilog folder contains the ISE project.
